# Introduction to Swift programming

Swift is an open source general purpose programming language developed by Apple.
While the primary goal of Swift was to replace Objective-C for the design and realisation of macOS and iOS applications, it has since gained popularity on the server-side.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to become familiar with Swift and its concepts.
Most of the presented examples are inspired by the Apple guide on Swift: [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097).
