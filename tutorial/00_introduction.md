# Introduction to Swift programming

Swift is an open source general purpose programming language developed by Apple.
While the primary goal of Swift was to replace Objective-C for the deelopment of macOS and iOS applications,
it has since gained popularity in other domains, such as the web frameworks.

This tutorial presents the important notions in Swift.
It is inspired by the [Swift Programming Language Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language).

It presents all notions in a consistent order.
All notions are illustrated with examples that incrementally build a small application:
a Pokemon simulator.

All the code snippets can be copy/pasted into the Swift [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop).
Just run the `swift` command in a terminal to get it.
