This blog is a collection of articles on Swift and Swift development.
It is admittedly highly opinionated, especially when it comes to what I consider good practices.
But it also contain (opinionated) information about things I'd like to have known when coding,
instead of spending 2 hours scrolling the Internet looking for it.

It also contains a more or less comprehensive [tutorial on Swift]({{ site.baseurl }}tutorial) to get beginners started.
